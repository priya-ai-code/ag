ng new age-calculator --create-application=false

Step 2:
ng generate library<library-name>
ng g library age-cal

Step 3:
Now add our library to our root package.json as
"build-library": "ng build age-cal‚Äù
npm run build-library

Step 4:
"pack-lib": "cd dist/age-cal&&npm pack"



Step 5:
Create a new angular application and install your library inside this using:
npm install <path-to-tgz-file>
Check your package.json to see if it has been installed and is reflected inside the dependencies.

Step 6: Import the module of your library and use the component.
app.module.ts
import { AgeCalModule } from'age-cal';

Add library component selector in app.compoment.html
<lib-age-cal></lib-age-cal>
